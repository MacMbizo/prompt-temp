# Code Quality and Maintainability Suggestions

This document captures suggestions for enhancing the code quality and maintainability of the project, to be implemented after current enhancements are complete.

## 1. Consistent Error Handling
- Implement a centralized error handling strategy.
- Utilize React Error Boundaries for UI errors.
- Establish a consistent logging mechanism for API call failures.

## 2. Scalable State Management
- For larger applications, consider adopting a more robust state management library (e.g., Redux Toolkit, Zustand, Jotai) for complex interactions and data flows.

## 3. Component Granularity
- Continue to break down large components into smaller, more focused, reusable, testable, and readable components.
- Example: For `SearchHistoryPanel`, create sub-components for each tab's content (e.g., `RecentSearchesList`, `SavedSearchesList`).

## 4. Code Consistency (Linting & Formatting)
- Ensure ESLint and Prettier are configured and integrated into the development workflow.
- Enforce consistent code style and catch potential errors early.

## 5. Comprehensive Testing
- Expand the test suite to include:
    - **Unit Tests**: For individual functions and small components (e.g., `useSearchHistory` hook, `SaveSearchDialog`).
    - **Integration Tests**: To verify interactions between components (e.g., `FilterSection` and `SearchHistoryPanel`).
    - **End-to-End Tests**: Using tools like Cypress or Playwright to simulate user flows.

## 6. Documentation
- Add JSDoc comments for functions, components, and complex logic.
- Consider adding more specific component-level documentation within the `docs/` folder.

## 7. Performance Optimization
- Implement performance optimization techniques such as:
    - `React.memo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
    - `useCallback` and `useMemo` for memoization.
    - Lazy loading components with `React.lazy` and `Suspense` for improved initial load times.
