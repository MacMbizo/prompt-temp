# Code Quality and Maintainability Suggestions

This document captures suggestions for enhancing the code quality and maintainability of the project, to be implemented after current enhancements are complete.

## Recently Completed Enhancements ✅

### CSV Import/Export Support (IET-2)
- **Status**: ✅ Completed
- **Description**: Enhanced the import/export functionality to support both JSON and CSV formats
- **Implementation**: 
  - Added `ExportFormat` and `ImportFormat` types to `useImportExport.ts`
  - Implemented `convertToCSV()` and `parseCSV()` helper functions
  - Updated `exportPrompts()` and `importPrompts()` to handle both formats
  - Enhanced `ImportExportModal` with format selection dropdowns
  - Added proper error handling and validation for CSV parsing
- **Benefits**: Users can now export prompts to CSV for spreadsheet analysis and import from CSV files, improving data portability and integration with external tools

### Prompt Version Control System (CF-2)
- **Status**: ✅ Completed
- **Description**: Complete version control system for prompts with automatic versioning, history tracking, and restoration capabilities
- **Implementation**: 
  - Created database migration with `prompt_versions` table and automatic versioning triggers
  - Added `current_version` and `version_count` fields to prompts table
  - Updated `Prompt` interface and created `PromptVersion` interface in types
  - Implemented `usePromptVersions` hook with comprehensive version management functions
  - Created `VersionHistoryModal` component for viewing, comparing, and restoring versions
  - Added version history button to `PromptCardDropdown` for prompt owners
  - Integrated version control into existing prompt card components
- **Benefits**: 
  - Automatic version creation on every prompt update
  - Manual version creation with custom change summaries
  - Complete version history viewing with timestamps and change descriptions
  - Version comparison functionality to see differences between versions
  - One-click version restoration to rollback changes
  - Owner-only access ensuring proper permissions

## 1. Consistent Error Handling
- Implement a centralized error handling strategy.
- Utilize React Error Boundaries for UI errors.
- Establish a consistent logging mechanism for API call failures.

## 2. Scalable State Management
- For larger applications, consider adopting a more robust state management library (e.g., Redux Toolkit, Zustand, Jotai) for complex interactions and data flows.

## 3. Component Granularity
- Continue to break down large components into smaller, more focused, reusable, testable, and readable components.
- Example: For `SearchHistoryPanel`, create sub-components for each tab's content (e.g., `RecentSearchesList`, `SavedSearchesList`).

## 4. Code Consistency (Linting & Formatting)
- Ensure ESLint and Prettier are configured and integrated into the development workflow.
- Enforce consistent code style and catch potential errors early.

## 5. Comprehensive Testing
- Expand the test suite to include:
    - **Unit Tests**: For individual functions and small components (e.g., `useSearchHistory` hook, `SaveSearchDialog`).
    - **Integration Tests**: To verify interactions between components (e.g., `FilterSection` and `SearchHistoryPanel`).
    - **End-to-End Tests**: Using tools like Cypress or Playwright to simulate user flows.

## 6. Documentation
- Add JSDoc comments for functions, components, and complex logic.
- Consider adding more specific component-level documentation within the `docs/` folder.

## 7. Performance Optimization
- Implement performance optimization techniques such as:
    - `React.memo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
    - `useCallback` and `useMemo` for memoization.
    - Lazy loading components with `React.lazy` and `Suspense` for improved initial load times.

## 8. Database Schema Evolution and Migration Management
- Establish a clear process for database schema changes, including versioning and rollback strategies.
- Ensure all schema modifications are managed through migrations (e.g., using Supabase migrations, Flyway, or Liquibase) to maintain consistency across environments.
- Document schema changes and their impact on existing data and application logic.

## 9. Automated API Client Generation
- Explore tools for automated generation of API clients (e.g., OpenAPI Generator, GraphQL Code Generator) from schema definitions.
- This can reduce manual errors, ensure type safety, and speed up development when interacting with the backend API.
